## Key Concepts

### 1️⃣ Virtual Machine (VM)
- Behaves like a physical server with a **guest OS** (Windows, Linux, etc.)
- Guest OS **is unaware** it runs on a VM
- VMs **share physical resources** of an ESXi host (CPU, memory, network, storage)
- Benefits:
  - Run multiple VMs on **shared hardware**
  - **Independent guest OS** on the same host

### 2️⃣ ESXi Host
- **Physical server** where VMs run
- **Type-1 hypervisor**: installed directly on hardware
- Provides **CPU, memory, network, storage** to VMs
- Example: VMware Workstation is Type-2 hypervisor (runs on OS)

### 3️⃣ Hypervisor Layer of Abstraction 🖥️
- Adds a **layer between physical resources and VMs**
- Controls VM access to CPU, memory, network, storage
- Enables **oversubscription** and resource management
- Analogy: Covering a bowl of M&Ms to hide resources from others 🥣

### 4️⃣ Resource Virtualization

#### a) CPU Virtualization
- Physical CPU cores **shared** among multiple VMs
- **Oversubscription**: allocate more virtual CPUs than physical
- Efficient: not all VMs peak simultaneously
- Analogy: restaurant seating 50 people, serving 200 daily

#### b) Memory Virtualization
- VM memory allocation can exceed physical memory
- Hypervisor maps virtual memory to physical memory dynamically
- Ensures performance balance

#### c) Network Virtualization 🌐
- **vSphere Standard Switch**: virtual switch for VMs
- VMs communicate internally and externally
- Provides **network connectivity** without physical cables

#### d) Storage Virtualization 💾
- VMs have virtual disks (VMDK files)
- ESXi intercepts storage commands (SCSI) and redirects to **datastores**
- Datastores: prepared storage for VM files (VMFS, vSAN, virtual volumes)

### 5️⃣ Virtual Machine Components
- **Live state**: memory contents, CPU scheduling, virtual NIC, storage I/O
- **Files on datastore**:
  - VMDK: virtual disk
  - VMX: VM configuration
- Powered off: live state removed; files remain for next boot

### 6️⃣ Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) 🏢
- Multiple VMs running on multiple ESXi hosts
- Virtualized **CPU, memory, network, storage**
- Can span **multiple physical locations**
- Scalable, dynamic vs physical data centers

### 7️⃣ Cloud Concepts ☁️
- **Private Cloud**: your own ESXi infrastructure
- **Public Cloud**: third-party provider (AWS) offers compute & storage
- **Hybrid Cloud**: combination of private and public clouds

### 8️⃣ Summary of Virtualization
- VM = guest OS + virtual hardware
- ESXi = Type-1 hypervisor providing shared resources
- Layer of abstraction manages VM access to physical resources
- Virtualization enables SDDC and cloud capabilities
