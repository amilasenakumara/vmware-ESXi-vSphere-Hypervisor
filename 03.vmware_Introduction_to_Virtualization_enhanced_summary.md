# VMware ESXi & Virtualization Enhanced Study Guide

## Introduction 🎯
This guide is designed for VMware ESXi experts aiming for certifications (VCP) and career advancement. It includes virtualization concepts, practical examples, diagrams, and exam/interview preparation.

## 1️⃣ Virtual Machine & ESXi Overview
- **VM (Virtual Machine)**: guest OS unaware it's virtualized; shares physical resources (CPU, memory, network, storage)
- **ESXi Host**: Type-1 hypervisor installed directly on hardware
- **Hypervisor Layer**: abstraction between VMs and physical resources; manages CPU/memory/network/storage access
- **Benefits**: multiple VMs on one host, independent guest OS, efficient resource utilization

### Visual Aid: Hypervisor Layer
```

   │      └── VM3
```

## 2️⃣ Resource Virtualization

### a) CPU Virtualization
- Multiple VMs share CPU cores
- Oversubscription allowed: vCPUs > physical CPUs
- Analogy: restaurant seats vs daily visitors

### b) Memory Virtualization
- Virtual memory allocation can exceed physical memory
- Hypervisor maps memory dynamically as VMs request it

### c) Network Virtualization 🌐
- **vSphere Standard Switch (vSS)**: virtual switch for VM communication
- VMs can communicate internally or externally
- VLANs and NIC teaming supported

### d) Storage Virtualization 💾
- VMs use virtual disks (VMDK) stored on datastores
- Datastore types: VMFS, vSAN, Virtual Volumes
- Hypervisor redirects SCSI commands to physical storage

### Visual Aid: Resource Layers
```

├─ Memory vRAM
├─ Virtual NICs
└─ VMDK Disks

```

## 3️⃣ VM Components
- **Live State**: memory contents, CPU scheduling, virtual NIC activity
- **VM Files**: VMX (configuration), VMDK (virtual disk)
- Powered-off VMs: live state cleared, files remain for next boot

## 4️⃣ Hands-On Examples

### a) Creating a VM
```bash
# Access ESXi via vSphere Client
# New Virtual Machine -> Select OS -> Allocate CPU, Memory, Disk
```

### b) Configuring Network
```bash
# Connect VM to vSphere Standard Switch
# Assign port group and VLAN
```

### c) Storage Management
```bash
# Add new VMDK or attach existing datastore
# Enable VM snapshots
```

### d) CLI Commands
```bash
esxcli system version get      # Show ESXi version
vim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms       # List all VMs
vim-cmd vmsvc/power.on <vmid> # Power on VM
```
